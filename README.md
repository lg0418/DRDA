# DRDA
This code is used to solve the spectrum resources allocation problem for AR requests. AR requests can tolerate certain delay if they can be completed before deadline.

The code is run by global.py
The comparison algorithms are LTC, LSR, RDDR and DDPG algorithms, corresponding to the LTC.py, LSR.py, Min_RDDR.py and DDPG.py.
RL.py and DDPG.py are the DRL models based on DQN and DDPG.
