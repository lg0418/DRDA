# DRDA
This code is used to solve the spectrum resources allocation problem for AR requests. AR requests can tolerate certain delay if they can be completed before deadline.
We propose the DRDA algorithm based on DRL to solve AR resource allocation problem in EONs, which can refer to DRDA.py.
The code is run by global.py, and the comparison algorithms are LTC, LSR, RDDR and DDPG algorithms, corresponding to the LTC.py, LSR.py, Min_RDDR.py and DDPG.py.
